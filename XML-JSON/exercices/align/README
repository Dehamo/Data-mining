LIMSI sentence alignment confidence annotation corpus

A collection of confidence annotations for sentence alignments. 

This resource has been produced in the course of the TransRead
Project (https://transread.limsi.fr) funded by the French National
Research Agency under contract ANR-12-CORD-0015.

and sub-sentential alignments of bi-texts. Proceedings of 10th Language
Resources and Evaluation Conference (LREC 2016). Portorož (Slovenia).

===========================
CONTENT/STRUCTURE
===========================

Five confidence annotation tags have been used:
1. "sure": the pair of sentences are (near) perfect mutual translations;
2. "partial": one side contains some parts that are not translated on the other side;
3. "unperfect": the pair constitutes a loose full mutual translation, or a translation only in specific contexts;
4. "not corresponding": the pair has no correspondence relation at all;
5. "undecidable": none of the previous four cases, mainly for pairs which are highly context-dependent and cannot be annotated in isolation.

Three annotators have annotated 1,800 pairs of English-French sentences.
Each pair is annotated twice, by two different annotators.
One pair takes 5 lines in the annotation document:
- sentence pair ID;
- source sentence;
- target sentence;
- first annotation (with untranslated word indices if the tag is "partial");
- second annotation (with untranslated word indices if the tag is "partial").

For each sentence, the word indice begins at 0.

The distribution of work among the three annotators :
  - 3000-3599.txt : Annotator 1, Annotator 2
  - 3600-4199.txt : Annotator 1, Annotator 3
  - 4200-4799.txt : Annotator 2, Annotator 3
